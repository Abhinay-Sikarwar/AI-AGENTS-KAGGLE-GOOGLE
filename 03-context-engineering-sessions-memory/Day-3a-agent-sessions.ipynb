The traditional drug discovery process is lengthy, expensive, and has a high failure rate. AI is poised to revolutionize this by making it faster, more efficient, and more successful.\n\nHere are some of the key areas of innovation in drug discovery:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify novel disease-associated genes, proteins, and pathways that can serve as drug targets. This goes beyond what human researchers could manually sift through.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can help predict whether a newly identified target is \"druggable,\" meaning whether a molecule can effectively bind to it and elicit a therapeutic effect.\n\n**2. Generative AI for *De Novo* Drug Design:**\n\n*   **Creating Novel Molecules:** This is perhaps one of the most groundbreaking areas. Generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models) can design entirely new molecular structures from scratch that are optimized for specific properties, such as binding affinity to a target, solubility, and low toxicity.\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** These models can explore a far larger chemical space than traditional methods, potentially uncovering molecules with unique mechanisms of action.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are using generative AI to design small molecules, peptides, and even antibodies.\n\n**3. Enhanced Hit Identification and Lead Optimization:**\n\n*   **Virtual Screening:** AI can rapidly screen massive libraries of existing compounds (billions of molecules) against a target to identify potential \"hits\" that show promise. This is much faster and more cost-effective than traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Predicting Binding Affinity and Efficacy:** AI models can predict how strongly a molecule will bind to a target and its potential efficacy, helping to prioritize the most promising candidates.\n*   **Optimizing Drug Properties:** AI can guide the optimization of lead compounds by suggesting chemical modifications that improve their pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and reduce potential side effects.\n\n**4. AI in Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n\n*   **Understanding Drug Targets:** Accurate protein structure prediction is crucial for understanding how drugs interact with their targets. AI models like **AlphaFold** (from DeepMind/Google) have made dramatic progress in predicting protein structures with remarkable accuracy, providing invaluable insights for drug design.\n*   **Rational Drug Design:** Knowing the precise 3D structure of a target protein allows for more rational and targeted drug design.\n\n**5. AI for Drug Repurposing:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze existing drug databases and scientific literature to identify existing drugs that might be effective against new diseases. This can significantly speed up the development timeline as the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs are already known.\n\n**6. Accelerating Preclinical and Clinical Development:**\n\n*   **Predicting Toxicity:** AI models can help predict potential toxicities of drug candidates early in the process, reducing the likelihood of late-stage failures.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, enabling more personalized treatment strategies and better patient selection for clinical trials.\n*   **Clinical Trial Optimization:** As mentioned before, AI can help design more efficient clinical trials, recruit the right patients, and analyze trial data more effectively.\n\n**Key Trends and Examples:**\n\n*   **AI-First Drug Discovery Companies:** A new wave of biotech companies are built entirely around AI platforms for drug discovery (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insitro, Atomwise, BenevolentAI).\n*   **Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are forming significant partnerships with AI drug discovery firms to leverage their technologies.\n*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** While AI is broadly applicable, there's a strong focus on areas like oncology, neuroscience, and rare diseases where unmet needs are high.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nWhile the progress is exciting, challenges persist.

This is a really exciting and rapidly evolving area within AI-powered drug discovery.\n\nLet me break it down further:\n\n**What is *De Novo* Drug Design?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery often involved screening existing libraries of compounds to find molecules that might interact with a disease target. *De Novo* design, on the other hand, means creating **new** molecules from scratch, specifically tailored to have desired properties.\n\n**How Generative AI Revolutionizes *De Novo* Design:**\n\nGenerative AI models are a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data that resembles the data they were trained on. In the context of drug discovery, they are trained on vast datasets of chemical structures and their associated properties. They then learn the underlying rules and patterns of chemistry to generate novel molecules.\n\nHere's how it works and what makes it so powerful:\n\n1.  **Learning Chemical \"Language\":** Generative models are trained on chemical representations (like SMILES strings or molecular graphs) and learn the \"grammar\" of chemistry – what makes a molecule stable, what functional groups are common, and how different parts of a molecule influence its behavior.\n\n2.  **Defining Desired Properties (The \"Prompt\"):** Researchers provide the AI with specific criteria or \"prompts\" for the new molecules they want to design. This can include:\n    *   **Target Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule should bind to a specific protein target involved in a disease.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring the molecule binds only to the intended target and not others, reducing off-target effects.\n    *   **Physicochemical Properties:** Desired solubility, lipophilicity (fat-solubility), molecular weight, etc., which influence how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body.\n    *   **ADMET Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity):** Designing molecules with favorable ADMET profiles from the outset can reduce the risk of failure later in development.\n    *   **Synthetic Feasibility:** In some advanced models, the AI can also be guided to design molecules that are practical to synthesize in a lab.\n\n3.  **Generating Novel Structures:** Based on the learned chemical rules and the specified properties, the generative model then proposes entirely new molecular structures. These are not modifications of existing drugs; they are novel chemical entities.\n\n4.  **Iterative Design and Refinement:** The process is often iterative. The AI might generate a set of candidate molecules, which are then evaluated (either computationally or experimentally). The results of this evaluation are fed back into the AI to refine its next generation of designs, progressively improving the quality and suitability of the candidates.\n\n**Key Generative AI Architectures Used:**\n\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules and can then sample from this space to generate new ones.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs involve two neural networks – a generator that creates molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish real molecules from generated ones. This adversarial process pushes the generator to create increasingly realistic and valid molecules.\n*   **Diffusion Models:** These models work by gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse the process, effectively \"denoising\" to generate new, high-quality data (in this case, molecules). They are showing remarkable results in generating diverse and novel structures.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used in conjunction with generative models to \"reward\" the AI for generating molecules that meet specific criteria, further optimizing the design process.\n\n**Why is this so impactful?**\n\n*   **Exploration of Uncharted Chemical Space:** Traditional methods are limited by the available chemical libraries. Generative AI can explore vast, previously inaccessible regions of chemical space, potentially uncovering entirely new classes of drugs with novel mechanisms of action.\n*   **Accelerated Design Cycles:** Designing molecules from scratch can be significantly faster with AI compared to traditional trial-and-error or rational design approaches.\n*   **Improved Efficacy and Safety:** By optimizing for multiple properties simultaneously from the design stage, AI can lead to drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects.\n*   **Tackling Difficult Targets:** Generative AI can be particularly useful for designing drugs against targets that have been historically difficult to drug using conventional methods.\n\n**Examples in Action:**\n\nSeveral AI-first drug discovery companies are making significant strides in this area. They are designing novel small molecules for various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and infectious diseases. Some of these generated molecules are already progressing through preclinical testing and, in some cases, entering clinical trials.\n\nIn essence, generative AI for *de novo* drug design is about building molecules with purpose, leveraging computational power to explore the vast landscape of chemistry and create the next generation of targeted and effective medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in generative AI for *de novo* drug design is rapidly expanding, encompassing both established pharmaceutical giants and innovative AI-first biotech startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
