Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**. This is a team of simple, specialized agents that collaborate, just like a real-world team. Each agent has one clear job (e.g., one agent *only* does research, another *only* writes).

What if you could break down those massive projects into smaller, smarter, and more collaborative units? Enter multi-agent systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's transforming how we build and manage software. Get ready to discover how MAS can make your development life easier and your applications more robust.\n\n---\n\n### Section 1: The Power of Decomposition: Taming Complexity\n\n*   **Modularization on Steroids:** MAS allows you to break down intricate problems into independent, self-contained agents, each responsible for a specific task or domain. This dramatically simplifies design and development.\n*   **Focused Development Teams:** Imagine each agent being handled by a specialized developer or team. This focused approach leads to cleaner code, faster iteration, and reduced interdependencies.\n*   **Enhanced Maintainability and Scalability:** When issues arise, you can isolate and fix problems within individual agents without affecting the entire system, making updates and scaling significantly more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### Section 2: Intelligence and Autonomy: Smarter Software, Smarter Solutions\n\n*   **Decentralized Decision-Making:** Agents can make decisions and act autonomously based on their own goals and perceptions, leading to more dynamic and adaptive systems.\n*   **Learning and Adaptation:** Many MAS frameworks support agents that can learn from experience and adapt their behavior over time, making your software more resilient to changing environments.\n*   **Parallel Processing and Efficiency:** Agents can operate in parallel, distributing workloads and improving overall system performance and responsiveness, especially for tasks that can be naturally parallelized.\n\n---\n\n### Section 3: Collaboration and Coordination: The Synergy Effect\n\n*   **Inter-Agent Communication:** MAS provides robust mechanisms for agents to communicate, negotiate, and share information, fostering a collaborative environment.\n*   **Emergent Behavior:** The interaction of multiple intelligent agents can lead to complex, intelligent, and often unexpected emergent behaviors that solve problems in novel ways.\n*   **Robustness and Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, others can often take over its responsibilities or compensate for the loss, leading to more resilient and fault-tolerant applications.\n\n---\n\n### Section 4: Practical Applications and Developer Advantages\n\n*   **Solving Real-World Problems:** From complex simulations and logistics to smart grids and robotic control, MAS are being used to tackle some of the most challenging problems.\n*   **Increased Developer Productivity:** By abstracting away low-level coordination and providing intelligent components, MAS allows developers to focus on higher-level logic and business value.\n*   **Reduced Development Time and Cost:** The modularity, reusability of agents, and increased efficiency can lead to faster development cycles and ultimately, cost savings.\n\n---\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Multi-agent systems aren't just a theoretical concept; they are a powerful toolkit for modern software development. By embracing decomposition, intelligence, and collaboration, developers can build more sophisticated, adaptable, and efficient software solutions than ever before. It's time to start thinking in terms of agents and unlock a new era of software innovation.\nWriterAgent > ## Supercharge Your Software: Unleash the Power of Multi-Agent Systems\n\nFeeling buried under the weight of complex software challenges? What if you could chop those behemoth projects into smaller, smarter, and more cooperative parts? That’s precisely the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a transformative approach poised to revolutionize your development workflow.\n\nMAS fundamentally shifts how we tackle software design through **decomposition**. Instead of a monolithic beast, imagine breaking down intricate problems into independent, self-contained **agents**. Each agent is a specialist, handling a specific task or domain. This modularity makes design dramatically simpler and allows for focused development. Think of it: specialized teams or developers owning individual agents, leading to cleaner code, faster iteration, and significantly reduced interdependencies. Plus, when bugs pop up, you can pinpoint and fix issues within a single agent without crashing the entire system, boosting maintainability and scalability.\n\nBut MAS isn't just about division; it's about **intelligence and autonomy**. These agents can make decisions and act independently, responding to their environment and pursuing their own goals. This leads to more dynamic and adaptive software. Many MAS frameworks even support agents that learn and evolve over time, making your applications incredibly resilient. And because agents can operate in parallel, you unlock massive performance gains, distributing workloads and enhancing responsiveness, especially for tasks that are naturally parallelizable.\n\nFinally, the magic truly happens with **collaboration**. MAS provides robust mechanisms for agents to communicate, negotiate, and share information, creating a synergistic environment. The interaction of these intelligent agents can lead to surprising, emergent behaviors that solve problems in entirely new ways. This decentralized approach also bolsters **robustness and fault tolerance**; if one agent falters, others can often pick up the slack, ensuring your application keeps running smoothly.\n\nBy embracing decomposition, intelligence, and collaboration, MAS empowers developers to build more sophisticated, adaptable, and efficient software. It’s time to start thinking in terms of agents and unlock a new era of software innovation.\nEditorAgent > Okay, EditorAgent, I've reviewed the draft provided by WriterAgent based on the outline.

What if the first draft of our story is bad?

For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world, its rhythmic beam a steady pulse against the encroaching dark. Tonight, however, a different light caught his eye. Tucked beneath a loose stone near the base, a rolled parchment shimmered with an otherworldly phosphorescence.\n\nHe unfurled it carefully. It wasn't paper, but some sort of smooth, supple hide. Etched upon it in glowing, silver lines was a map, unlike any he’d ever seen. Islands that defied known geography, currents marked by pulsing light, and a single, radiant ‘X’ at its heart. Elias’s heart, usually as predictable as the tides, began to race. The sea outside seemed to hum in response.\nCriticAgent > The plot is intriguing, setting up a classic mystery with the discovery of the map. However, it feels a bit rushed. The pacing is very fast, leaving little room for Elias's reaction or the atmosphere to truly sink in.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n*   **Expand on Elias's character and his life before the discovery.** For thirty years, the lighthouse has been his world. What has that been like? Show us more of his quiet routine, his connection to the sea, and perhaps a hint of longing or routine that makes this discovery so disruptive and exciting. This will make his racing heart and the sea's hum feel more earned.\n*   **Slow down the discovery moment.** Describe Elias's initial noticing of the light, his investigation of the loose stone, and the texture and feel of the hide map in more detail. This will build suspense and allow the reader to share in the wonder of the artifact.\n*   **Introduce a hint of the map's potential implications.** Instead of just stating it's a map Elias has never seen, perhaps he recognizes a single, familiar (though oddly rendered) landmark, or the pulsing light of the currents sparks a vague, forgotten legend. This will deepen the mystery and give Elias a more immediate hook for what the map might lead to.\nRefinerAgent > Elias ran a calloused thumb over the worn brass of the lighthouse railing, the metal cool beneath his touch. Thirty years. Thirty years of this isolated tower, of the endless, shifting blues and greys of the sea, of the predictable sweep of the beam cutting through the night. His life was a quiet rhythm of polished brass, tempered glass, and the lonely cry of gulls. He found a certain peace in the monotony, a comfort in the unchanging cycle of day and night, tide and ebb. Yet, sometimes, in the deep quiet of the ocean’s breath, a flicker of something more, a forgotten echo of a life before this steadfast solitude, would stir within him.\n\nTonight, the sea was a restless whisper, and the air, thick with salt and the scent of damp stone, felt charged with an unusual energy. It was during his nightly rounds, the familiar routine of checking the lamp and the perimeter, that a peculiar light snagged his attention. Not the steady, warm glow of his lighthouse, but a faint, ethereal shimmer emanating from the very base of the tower. It pulsed softly, a cool, phosphorescent beckoning. Curiosity, a feeling Elias hadn’t indulged in years, tugged him closer. He knelt, his old knees protesting, and brushed away a clump of sea-worn moss near a noticeably loose stone. Beneath it, nestled in the dark earth, lay a tightly rolled cylinder.\n\nHis fingers, usually steady from decades of meticulous work, fumbled slightly as he reached for it. It wasn't parchment, brittle and dry, but something far more yielding. It felt like ancient, supple hide, impossibly smooth, cool to the touch. As he carefully unfurled it, the soft glow intensified, revealing intricate etchings. Silver lines, alive with their own internal light, pulsed and flowed across the surface, forming a map. But this was no chart of any known ocean. Islands floated in impossible configurations, their outlines sharp against the glowing sea. Currents, depicted not by simple lines but by streams of pulsing light, suggested flows and eddies that defied the predictable tides he knew so well. And there, at the very heart of this alien geography, pulsed a single, radiant ‘X’. Elias’s breath hitched. His heart, usually as steady and reliable as the lighthouse’s chronometer, began a frantic, unfamiliar drum against his ribs. The hum of the sea outside seemed to deepen, no longer a whisper but a resonant chord, as if acknowledging the unveiling of a secret long held. A forgotten legend, a tale his grandmother used to whisper of islands that sailed the seas, pricked at the edges of his memory, now illuminated by the silver glow of the map.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
